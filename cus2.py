# CUS2 - Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) Search with Tie-Breaking Rule:
# - Repeatedly performs depth-first search using an increasing f-cost bound, where f(n) = g(n) + h(n), until a path to a goal node is determined
# - Optimises for total sum of traversed edge costs
# If all else equal:
# 1. prefer lower total path cost
# 2. if equal cost, prefer smaller goal node number
# 3. if equal cost and same goal node number, prefer the path found first
